\f0\fs24 \cf0 Paris and I distributed the different tasks according to our own set of skills all while discussing and working together. Paris was a great coworker for this project and helped me not only to create a cohesive concept but also to assist and explain aspects of the project which were not my strongest skill. Paris handled the writing part and the research while I was more focused on the back end programming. We both handled the manual work equally and shared our knowledge with each other throughout the project. \
